# Budget and Expense tracking

This is a project to develop a java based expense tracking application.

---

This application is still in the early stages of development with minimal functionality at this point. Please refer
to `DevelopmentLog.md` for more information about the development progress and general ideas I have about the vision
and direction of the application.

This project is mainly an effort to build an MVC application with a persistent database.

Eventual project goals include:
* Ability for users to create charges tied to a specific account
* Ability for users to create their unique tags for a charges
* Ability for users to run simple to moderately complex analyses of their data once they have a fair amount stored
* Ability to create new users (Spring security?)
